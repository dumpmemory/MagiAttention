MagiAttention documentation
===================================

**Overview :**

MagiAttention is a distributed attention mechanism, or context-parallel (CP) strategy, which aims to support a wide variety of attention mask types with **kernel-level flexibility**, while achieving **linear scalability** with respect to context-parallel (CP) size across a broad range of scenarios, particularly suitable for training tasks involving <u><em>ultra-long, heterogeneous mask</em></u> training like video-generation for [Magi-1](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MAGI-1).

We are committed to continually improving the performance and generality of MagiAttention for the broader research community. Stay tuned for exciting enhancements and new features on the horizon!
