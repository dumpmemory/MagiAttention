## Overview

Overview of MagiAttention: (1) `FFA` - an optimized kernel based on `Flash-Attention 3`, further supports flexible mask patterns; (2) The `dispatch solver` shards ultra‑long data and dispatches for load-balanced computation; (3) `GroupCast` and `GroupReduce` primitives eliminate redundant communication; (4) The `overlap solver` adaptively partitons multi-stage computation/communication for optimal overlap; (5) Forward and backward timelines scheduled by MagiAttention. With all components together, MagiAttention enables linear scalability in training with ultra‑long contexts and heterogeneous masks.
```

Training large-scale video‑generation models faces two tightly coupled challenges: (1) ultra‑long contexts—reaching millions of tokens (e.g., **~4M**)—which make attention prohibitively expensive in compute and memory, and (2) highly heterogeneous, irregular attention masks (e.g., block‑causal + Patch‑and‑Pack) that break assumptions of existing kernels and distributed layouts, leading to fragmentation, load imbalance, wasted padding, and large communication overhead.

These same constraints also affect (multimodal) LLMs that aim to support ultra‑long histories and flexible masking for agentic tasks with large retrievals and deep reasoning. <u>Therefore, we require an efficient, mask-flexible, and scalable distributed attention solution</u>.

To address these challenges, we propose [MagiAttention](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MagiAttention), which targets these bottlenecks with **kernel-level flexibility**, while achieving **distributed-level linear scalability** across a broad range of training scenarios, particularly for those involving ultra-long contexts and heterogeneous masks like [Magi-1](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MAGI-1).


## Introduction

Training large-scale autoregressive diffusion models for video generation (e.g., [Magi-1](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MAGI-1)) creates two tightly coupled system challenges. First, training contexts can reach millions of tokens, so naive quadratic attention or inadequately sharded algorithms quickly become infeasible in both compute and memory. Second, practical data pipelines—for example, block‑causal attention combined with Patch‑and‑Pack (PnP) processing {cite}`dehghani2023patchnpacknavit` — produce highly heterogeneous, irregular masks and variable sequence lengths that violate assumptions made by standard attention kernels and distributed layouts. The combined effect is severe fragmentation, imbalanced compute across ranks, excessive padding, and large, often redundant, communication volumes.

Prior context‑parallel solutions {cite}`jacobs2023deepspeed,liu2023ringattentionblockwisetransformers,fang2024uspunifiedsequenceparallelism,gu2024loongtrainefficienttraininglongsequence,chen2024longvilascalinglongcontextvisual` partially mitigate these issues but introduce new limitations: head‑sharded designs impose divisibility constraints and reduce flexibility, ring‑style P2P schemes scale but incur large communication and redundancy under sparse/varlen masks. While recent efforts {cite}`wang2024datacentricheterogeneityadaptivesequenceparallelism,zhang2024dcp,ge2025bytescaleefficientscalingllm,megatron-lm-hybrid-cp-pr-2054` dynamically adjust CP sizes to avoid unnecessary sharding and redundant communication for shorter sequences, they still incur extra memory overhead for NCCL buffers and involve complex scheduling to balance loads and synchronize across different subsets of ranks.

Crucially, existing methods do not simultaneously (1) provide a unified, distributable representation for a wide class of mask patterns, (2) guarantee balanced compute across context‑parallel (CP) ranks for arbitrarily structured masks, and (3) eliminate unnecessary data movement while enabling robust compute/communication overlap.

MagiAttention addresses these gaps by prioritizing kernel‑level flexibility together with distributed-level scalability, which depends on meeting the following fundamental conditions:

- <b>Linearly Scalable Attention Kernel</b>: The performance of the attention kernel should not degrade as CP size increases. To this end, we introduce [Flex-Flash-Attention](#flex-flash-attention), an extension of FlashAttention-3 (FA3), which natively considers the efficiency impact of attention mask partitioning in distributed environments. It supports distributable mask representations with a tailored kernel implementation to ensure scalability while accommodating a broader range of attention mask types.
- <b>Balanced Computational Workloads</b>: Imbalances in the computational load across CP ranks lead to unavoidable idle bubbles that hinder scalability. MagiAttention is natively designed to ensure [Computation Load Balancing](#computation-load-balancing), mitigating such inefficiencies.
- <b>Full Overlap of Communication and Computation</b>: Without sufficient overlap, increasing CP size results in communication-induced idle time on GPUs, impairing scalability. MagiAttention introduces novel [Zero-Redundant Communication Primitives](#zero-redundant-communication-primitives) to minimize communication overhead, along with an [Adaptive Multi-Stage Overlap](#multi-stage-computation-communication-overlap) strategy that enables effective communication-computation overlap.

By coordinating a mask‑flexible kernel, a load‑balancing dispatcher, and zero‑redundancy communication with adaptive overlap, MagiAttention supports a broad spectrum of attention patterns while delivering distributed-level linear scalability across realistic ultra‑long and heterogeneous training workloads.

Below, we briefly review current CP strategies in [Related Work](#related-work), present the key designs in [Methodology](#methodology), and report comprehensive experimental results that validate the approach in [Experiments](#experiments).

We further elaborate upon preliminaries, extended functionalities, optimization techniques, and next-generation design in [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous), followed by the [Future Work](#future-work) section. Our evolving exploration seeks to broaden the scope and redefine the frontiers of distributed attention, optimizing its performance for large-scale model training and extending its efficacy to inference scenarios in the future.


## Related Work

To handle ultra‑long contexts, context parallelism (CP) is essential, but existing CP strategies do not meet the real-world demanding settings.

DeepSpeed’s `Ulysses` {cite}`jacobs2023deepspeed` uses head-sharded attention with All-to-All transforms; it is easy to integrate but requires the number of heads to be divisible by the CP size, limiting scalability (e.g., GQA and when combined with head-aware tensor parallelism) {cite}`shoeybi2020megatronlm,korthikanti2022reducing`.

`Ring-Attention` {cite}`li2021sequence,liu2023ringattentionblockwisetransformers,wang2024tokenringefficientparallelismframework` keeps sequence-sharded activations and relies on multi-stage ring-style P2P communication for online attention and overlap {cite}`rabe2021self,dao2022flashattention,wang2022overlap`. It scales better than head-sharding but incurs large communication volumes and inefficient P2P primitives as CP size grows. Hybrid 2D schemes like `USP` {cite}`fang2024uspunifiedsequenceparallelism` and `LoongTrain` {cite}`gu2024loongtrainefficienttraininglongsequence,chen2024longvilascalinglongcontextvisual` combine `Ulysses` and `Ring-Attention` to reduce their weaknesses but still lack the fundamental efficiency and scalability needed for ultra‑long contexts.

Irregular masks (e.g., varlen) worsen these issues (see {numref}`ring_attn_load_balance` below). Naive <em>sequential even sharding</em> creates uneven mask-area distribution and imbalanced compute across ranks. Custom <em>zigzag sharding</em> {cite}`ring_flash_attention_issue2` can rebalance specific varlen causal patterns but causes fragmentation, excessive padding, and kernel slowdowns, and it does not generalize to patterns such as the <em>varlen block-causal mask</em> used in autoregressive video generation for [Magi-1](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MAGI-1).

Illustration of `Ring-Attention`'s sharding strategies for load balancing: (a) full mask — sequential sharding across the global mask; (b) causal mask — tailored *zigzag sharding* {cite}`ring_flash_attention_issue2`; (c) varlen full mask — sequential sharding per packed sample; (d) varlen causal mask — per-sample *zigzag sharding*, which increases fragmentation and padding and degrades performance.
```

Second, communication overhead worsens under sparse varlen masks because entire sequence chunks are transferred to all CP ranks—even when many ranks do not need them—yielding over **30% redundant communication**, as shown in [Zero-Redundant Communication Primitives](#zero-redundant-communication-primitives). Third, these inefficiencies undermine pipeline compute–communication overlap: imbalanced workloads and excessive communication make overlap fragile and constrain scalability.

Recent efforts like `DCP` {cite}`wang2024datacentricheterogeneityadaptivesequenceparallelism,zhang2024dcp,ge2025bytescaleefficientscalingllm` and `Hybrid-CP` {cite}`megatron-lm-hybrid-cp-pr-2054` reduce redundant sharding by dynamically assigning CP group sizes per sample based on sequence length. However, they introduce significant scheduling complexity, frequent cross-group synchronization, and extra NCCL buffer memory, lacking of a bottom-up redesign required for robust, mask-flexible, and scalable distributed attention.


## Methodology

### Flex-Flash-Attention

#### AttnSlice Representation

`Flash-Attention` {cite}`dao2022flashattention,dao2023flashattention,shah2024flashattention3fastaccurateattention,dao2025flashattention_cute` delivers high throughput, memory efficiency, and native support for varlen-packed inputs, making it a cornerstone for large-scale training. However, its kernels assume regular mask structure and do not handle irregular, rank-distributed masks efficiently—causing fragmentation, load imbalance, excess padding, and higher communication—so a mask‑flexible kernel that preserves Flash‑Attention’s performance is required {cite}`pytorch_sdpa,dong2024flexattentionprogrammingmodel,wang2025flashmaskefficientrichmask`.

Therefore, we introduce `Flex-Flash-Attention` (`FFA`), a kernel designed for distributed settings that flexibly handles diverse attention masks. `FFA` adopts a <b>distributable</b> representation that decomposes an irregular mask into multiple computational units called {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}`. Each {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}` is the triplet {math}`\mathrm{(QRange, KRange, MaskType)}`, denoting a submask confined to a contiguous 2D query–key region (see {numref}`attnslice_interpret` below).

:alt: AttnSlice Formulation

The mask is decomposed into multiple {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}` units, allowing fractal patterns to be re-expressed after redistribution across CP ranks to support distributed attention. Note that computation load balancing across CP ranks is not considered in this illustration.
```

As illustrated in {numref}`mask_with_attn_slice` below, this formulation expresses a wide range of attention masks—including the varlen block-causal mask used in [Magi-1](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MAGI-1)—as compositions of multiple triplets. These representations remain valid after sharding and rearrangement across ranks, making `FFA` well suited for distributed attention computation.

:alt: AttnSlice Mask Patterns

Examples of mask patterns expressed using {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}`: (a)–(d) are standard FA3-compatible patterns; (e)–(h) are irregular masks beyond Flash-Attention’s capability—e.g., the varlen block-causal mask—which `FFA` handles seamlessly while preserving FA3-comparable performance.
```

#### AttnSlice-level Parallelism in FFA

Built on `Flash-Attention 3` (`FA3`) kernels {cite}`shah2024flashattention3fastaccurateattention`, `FFA` leverages Hopper GPUs' TMA feature {cite}`nvidia2024accelerating` and implements {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}`-level parallelism with atomic operations for correctness (illustrated in {numref}`ffa_slice_atomic_reduce` below). `FFA` delivers MFU comparable to FA3 while supporting the flexible {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}` formulation—see [Attention Kernel Benchmark](./cp_benchmark.md#kernel-level) for detailed performance and flexibility comparisons.

#### Basic Mask Types in AttnSlice

Although most mask patterns can be expressed with {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}` using the common types {math}`\lbrace\texttt{FULL}, \texttt{CAUSAL}\rbrace`, some patterns—e.g., {math}`\textit{sliding-window}`—become inefficient because they require expressing each row individually. To represent such patterns compactly, we introduce two additional mask types, {math}`\lbrace\texttt{INV-CAUSAL}, \texttt{BI-CAUSAL}\rbrace`. The following {numref}`attn_slice_mask_type_sq=sk`, {numref}`attn_slice_mask_type_sq<sk`, and {numref}`attn_slice_mask_type_sq>sk` illustrate examples of the current {math}`4` supported mask types.

Using the four supported mask types, we illustrate common {math}`\textit{sliding-window}`-style masks expressed via the {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}` formulation (see {numref}`sw_mask_with_slice` below).

### Computation Load-Balancing

#### Dispatch Solver

In context-parallel training, heterogeneous attention masks across CP ranks create imbalanced computational workloads. `Ring-Attention` (see [Related Work](#related-work)) uses a partitioning strategy tailored to causal masks and therefore does not generalize to arbitrary patterns. To address this, we propose a generic, efficient `dispatch solver` that balances workload across CP ranks for diverse attention types.

Concretely, we adopt a chunk-wise permutable sharding: partition the global mask evenly along the query dimension into chunks, each associated with a submask area {math}`\lbrace(C_i, \mathrm{Area}(C_i))\rbrace_{i=1}^n`, where {math}`C_i` denotes the i-th chunk, {math}`\mathrm{Area}(C_i)` is its mask area, {math}`n = \frac{seqlen}{\textit{chunk\_size}}`, and {math}`\textit{chunk\_size}` is a tunable granularity parameter.

These chunks are assigned equally to {math}`\textit{cp\_size}` buckets so every bucket contains the same number of chunks (preserving token-level balance for non-attention stages). Each bucket's total mask workload is the summed submask area, written as {math}`\lbrace(B_j, \mathrm{SumArea}(B_j))\rbrace_{j=1}^{\textit{cp\_size}}`.

Under this formulation, load balancing reduces to a combinatorial assignment problem: find an optimal mapping {math}`f^*: \lbrace C_i\rbrace_{i=1}^n \rightarrow \lbrace B_j\rbrace_{j=1}^{\textit{cp\_size}}` that minimizes the maximum per-bucket area, as shown in the Eq {eq}`eq:comp_load_balance` below.

```{math}
:label: eq:comp_load_balance

\begin{aligned}
  &f^* = \arg \min\limits_{f}\max\limits_{j}\left\{\mathrm{SumArea}(B_j)\right\} \label{eq:comp_load_balance}\\
  &\text{s.t.}\;\;|B_j| = \frac{n}{\textit{cp\_size}}, \;\; seqlen \;\%\; (\textit{cp\_size} \times \textit{chunk\_size}) = 0\nonumber
\end{aligned}
```

Since this problem is NP-hard and mask patterns change across micro-batches, solving it exactly per iteration is impractical. We therefore use a practical greedy Min-Heap algorithm (illustrated in {numref}`min_hp_alg` below) that runs in {math}`O(n\log n)` and yields a fast, effective assignment with minimal runtime overhead.

```

#### Static Attn Solver

Upon dispatching tensors along the seqlen dimension into {math}`n` chunks, the global mask is partitioned into {math}`n^2` submasks and each CP rank is assigned with {math}`n` submasks. Since each rank can process only one “host” submask along the principal diagonal of the global mask using local tensors, the remaining {math}`n\!-\!1` “remote” submasks require communication. This yields two essential but non-trivial meta structures:

- (1) **`CalcMeta`**: Encodes each submask as {math}`\mathrm{AttnSlice}` instances per rank (and per stage if using [multi-stage overlap](#multi-stage-computation-communication-overlap)) and supplies the arguments required by the `FFA` kernels for calculation.
- (2) **`CommMeta`**: Describes the data exchanges with other CP peers—what input tensors to fetch for `FFA` and how to reduce partial outputs per rank (and per stage if using [multi-stage overlap](#multi-stage-computation-communication-overlap))—producing the arguments for `GroupCast/GroupReduce` kernels for communication (see [group collective primitives](#zero-redundant-communication-primitives) for details).

To produce these, we design the `attn solver` data structure: it consumes the `dispatch solver` output and emits the `CalcMeta` and `CommMeta` needed to run distributed attention (forward and backward), i.e., the argument bundles for `FFA` and `GroupCast/GroupReduce` on each CP rank and stage. And we initially provide the `static attn solver` implementation that builds `CalcMeta` and `CommMeta` during the data preprocessing stage from the `dispatch solver` results, then invokes the `overlap solver` to derive multi‑stage schedules.

However, This `static attn solver` is based on the strong assumption that the **global mask is static**, i.e. (1) known at the data-processing stage for each micro-batch and (2) remains unchanged across the whole forward/backward passes at all attention layers. It also restricts to the [kv-comm only scheduling](#scheduling-with-kv-comm-only), that only {math}`\mathrm{KV}`-related tensors are allowed to be communicated while {math}`\mathrm{QO}`-related tensors stay local—limiting scheduling flexibility and overlap potential.

#### Dynamic Attn Solver

The `static attn solver` handles most standard training cases but is limited and suboptimal for dynamic mask scenarios—e.g., layer-varying hybrid attention {cite}`minimax2025minimax01scalingfoundationmodels` or dynamic sparse masks determined at runtime {cite}`yuan2025nativesparseattentionhardwarealigned,deepseekai2025deepseekv32pushingfrontieropen`.

To address this, we are developing an experimental `dynamic attn solver` that dynamically balances computation (*w/o relying on initial dispatch results by `dispatch solver`*) and minimizes communication **under general [scheduling with qo-comm enabled](#scheduling-with-qo-comm-enabled)**, relaxing the heuristics of the current [kv-comm only scheduling](#scheduling-with-kv-comm-only). Then it will be able to generate `CalcMeta` and `CommMeta` **on‑the‑fly** with negligible overhead during each attention-layer forward pass.

See the seperate [blog post](./dynamic_solver.md) for more details about the motivation, design, implementation, and preliminary results of the `dynamic attn solver`.


### Zero-Redundant Communication Primitives

#### Ring P2P Redundancy Analysis

Ring-style implementations rely on point-to-point (P2P) send/recv primitives that lack fine-grained communication control, causing unnecessary data movement. To quantify this, we record remote key-value ({math}`\mathrm{KV}`) requests and their gradients ({math}`\mathrm{dKV}`) under a causal mask as a simple example shown in {numref}`ring_p2p_redundancy`: in the forward pass {math}`\mathrm{KV}_0` must be sent to all devices via `BroadCast`, while {math}`\mathrm{dKV}_0` requires to be reduced via `AllReduce` during the backward. However, {math}`\mathrm{KV}_7` is required ONLY locally for its host {math}`rank_7` yet still circulates across all devices. This redundant even dissemination—and its cost—becomes more severe for varlen mask patterns.

```{figure} ../../../assets/magi_attn/comm/ring_p2p_redundancy.png
:name: ring_p2p_redundancy
:align: center
:width: 1000px
:alt: Ring P2P Redundant Communication

Examples of redundant communication in Ring P2P with heterogeneous masks: (a) a simple causal mask incurs **25%** redundant communication; (b) irregular masks, e.g., the varlen block-causal mask with the last global block, can exceed **33%** redundancy.
```

#### Group Collective Primitives

To address this, as illustrated in the {numref}`group_gather_reduce_all2allv` below, we introduce two communication primitives: `GroupCast` and `GroupReduce`, which model the communication patterns of low-demand {math}`\mathrm{KV}` and {math}`\mathrm{dKV}`. For example, in the causal mask, {math}`\mathrm{KV}_5` on {math}`\mathrm{rank}_2` is required only by {math}`\{\mathrm{Q}_6,\mathrm{Q}_7\}` and should be sent exclusively to the target ranks {math}`\{\mathrm{rank}_0, \mathrm{rank}_1\}` via `GroupCast`, while the partial {math}`\mathrm{dKV}_5` is collected and reduced back to {math}`\mathrm{rank}_2` via `GroupReduce` accordingly.

```{figure} ../../../assets/magi_attn/comm/group_gather_reduce_all2allv.png
:name: group_gather_reduce_all2allv
:align: center
:width: 1000px
:alt: GroupCast/GroupReduce Primitives

Illustration of `GroupCast/GroupReduce` primitives implemented atop `AlltoAll-v` to achieve zero redundancy, shown using the varlen block-causal mask with the last global block. (a) For forward and backward passes, `GroupCast` builds a transfer table for {math}`\mathrm{KV}` send/receive buffers, invokes `AlltoAll-v`, and uses a custom `Range-Gather` kernel for pre-/post-processing. (b) In the backward pass, `GroupReduce` aggregates partial {math}`\mathrm{dKV}` via `AlltoAll-v`, employing `Range-Gather` for pre-processing and `Range-Scatter-Reduce` for post-processing.
```

#### AlltoAll-v Implementation

Since no existing communication kernels support group collectives, we prototyped `GroupCast` and `GroupReduce` on top of `AlltoAll-v`, achieving zero-redundant communication in forward and backward passes (see {numref}`group_gather_reduce_all2allv`). This approach, however, requires additional pre-/post-processing: `GroupCast` must re-permute inputs for `AlltoAll-v` and restore outputs (`Range-Gather`), and `GroupReduce` also performs a reduction on the output (`Range-Scatter-Reduce`). Although we implemented these steps using optimized Triton kernels, the extra overhead remains non‑negligible and might impact end-to-end performance.

Besides the extra pre-/post-processing D2D overhead, another obscure cost of the `AlltoAll-v` implementation is that it permits only a single send/recv buffer pair per peer pair and therefore does not natively support "cast" semantics. Thus, to send a tensor from one rank to a subset of peers of size {math}`m`, one must allocate {math}`m` separate send buffers—one per destination—and transfer them individually, even though the data are identical. This **duplication** incurs substantial communication overhead, which is particularly severe when the CP group includes internode peers using `RDMA`, whose bandwidth is much lower than intranode `NVLink`.

#### Native Implementation

To mitigate the extra overhead of the `AlltoAll-v` implementation aforementioned, we develop a native CUDA kernel implementation of group collectives inspired by DeepEP {cite}`deepep2025`. It not only removes the pre-/post-processing D2D copies but also significantly improves efficiency via the optimization of **RDMA transfer de-duplication**, particularly for hierarchical CP groups spanning internode and intranode peers.

Although further optimizations remain, gains are already evident in the [Attention Benchmark](#attention-benchmark), particularly when scaling up the hierarchical CP group size. Please see the separate [blog post](./native_grpcoll.md) for more details about the motivation, design, implementation, and experimental results of the native implementation of group collectives.


### Multi-Stage Computation/Communication Overlap

#### Scheduling with KV-Comm Only

Leveraging previous optimizations, we combine an optimized kernel, load-balanced dispatch, and zero-redundant primitives to minimize communication overhead and maximize computation throughput individually. Now, to drive true linear scalability, we introduce an adaptive multi-stage computation/communication overlap strategy that effectively hides communication latency and can be tuned manually or automatically.

Similar to prior works {cite}`liu2023ringattentionblockwisetransformers,zhao2023pytorch,async_tensor_parallelism_in_pytorch`, we schedule pipeline stages to overlap computation and communication in both forward and backward passes (see {numref}`multi_stage_overlap_fwd_bwd`). Each {math}`\mathrm{rank}_i` partitions its remote {math}`\mathrm{KV}`/{math}`\mathrm{dKV}` exchanges into stages.

```{figure} ../../../assets/magi_attn/mso/multi_stage_overlap_fwd_bwd.png
:name: multi_stage_overlap_fwd_bwd
:align: center
:width: 1000px
:alt: Multi-Stage Overlap Scheduling

Illustration of Magi Attention’s multi-stage overlap scheduling. (a) Forward pass — a 4-stage schedule that overlaps computation (partial {math}`\mathrm{O}` and {math}`\mathrm{LSE}`) with prefetching of next-stage {math}`\mathrm{KV}` requests, hiding communication latency except for the final stage’s computation. (b) Backward pass — a 3-stage schedule that overlaps computation (partial {math}`\mathrm{dQ}`, {math}`\mathrm{dKV}`), next-stage {math}`\mathrm{KV}` prefetches, and reduction of prior {math}`\mathrm{dKV}` requests, leaving only the final stage of partial {math}`\mathrm{dKV}` reduction exposed.
```

In the forward pass, the scheduler launches the `GroupCast` kernel to prefetch the next {math}`(i\!+\!1)`-th stage of remote {math}`\mathrm{KV}` while asynchronously executing the current {math}`i`-th stage of the `FFA` kernel for partial attention. Since `local qkv` is always available for the initial stage, all communication latency is fully hidden, leaving only the final remote stage’s computation exposed.

In the backward pass, the scheduler prefetches the next {math}`(i\!+\!1)`-th stage of {math}`\mathrm{KV}` and invokes the `GroupReduce` kernel to reduce the prior {math}`(i\!-\!1)`-th stage of partial {math}`\mathrm{dKV}` before executing the current {math}`i`-th attention stage. This overlap conceals communication latency across stages, exposing only the final stage of partial {math}`\mathrm{dKV}` reduction.

#### Scheduling with QO-Comm Enabled

Initially, we follow the legacy heuristic that only {math}`\mathrm{KV}`-related tensors are communicated while {math}`\mathrm{QO}`-related tensors remain local, a common practice in prior works {cite}`liu2023ringattentionblockwisetransformers,fang2024uspunifiedsequenceparallelism`. This simplifies scheduling and often reduces communication, particularly in GQA settings where {math}`\mathrm{KV}` typically has lower volume than {math}`\mathrm{QO}`.

However, this heuristic is not fundamental and can be suboptimal for certain mask patterns and training setups. We therefore support a more general scheduler that permits communication of {math}`\mathrm{QO}` when advantageous. In the forward pass, the scheduler will prefetch the next stage of remote {math}`\mathrm{Q}` in addition to remote {math}`\mathrm{KV}`, overlapping both of them with the current `FFA` computation. And a major difference to {math}`\mathrm{KV}`-only schedule is that we also need to apply **{math}`\mathrm{LSE}`-reduction** for the previous stage’s partial {math}`\mathrm{O,LSE}` while overlapping with the current stage of computation.

In the backward pass, the scheduler will prefetch the next stage of remote {math}`\mathrm{KV}` and {math}`\mathrm{Q,O,dO,LSE}` and concurrently sum-reduce the prior stage’s partial {math}`\mathrm{dKV}` and {math}`\mathrm{dQ}`, overlapping with the current `FFA` backward computation.

Although the scheduler itself is already supported, enabling this mode also requires the `dynamic attn solver` to emit the corresponding `CalcMeta` and `CommMeta` for `FFA` and the group-collective kernels, which is under active development (see [Dynamic Attn Solver](#dynamic-attn-solver)). We will release it soon and continue to optimize it for better performance.

#### How to Ensure Kernels Actually Overlapped

While the CPU scheduler controls kernel launch order to favor overlap, the GPU Hyper-Q driver {cite}`bradley2013hyperq` ultimately determines actual execution order non‑deterministically, influenced by transient GPU resource occupancy as well. Ensuring reliable overlap between computation and communication kernels is therefore non‑trivial.

See the separate [blog post](./kernel_overlap.md) for practical techniques and our specific novel approaches.

#### Dynamic Overlap Stage Search

:::{warning}
In practice, {math}`\textit{overlap\_degree}` is typically tuned manually in {math}`\{1,2,3,4\}`. Automatic search by the `overlap solver` often underperforms because it requires accurate estimates of <em>computation-to-communication ratios</em>. We therefore recommend trying manual tuning for a few iterations to identify a suitable {math}`\textit{overlap\_degree}` before enabling automatic search, which we will continue to improve for greater robustness.
:::

To control overlap granularity, we introduce the tunable hyperparameter {math}`\textit{overlap\_degree}`, indicating the number of remote stages to be partitioned, which adapts to varying <em>computation-to-communication ratios</em> across training setups, microbatches, and between forward and backward passes. It can be set manually by the user on their own training setup. Or, we provide an algorithm to choose automatically by the `overlap solver` using the dynamic search described in the following {numref}`dynamic_mso_alg`.

## Experiments

### Attention Benchmark

To evaluate the performance and flexibility of `FFA` kernels and to validate the distributed scalability of `MagiAttention` for ultra-long, heterogeneous-mask training, we benchmark throughput on modern GPUs (e.g., Hopper and Blackwell) for both kernels and distributed attention modules in forward and backward passes across diverse mask patterns (standard and irregular), comparing against state-of-the-art kernel- and distributed-level baselines.

We present representative distributed-level benchmarks below for the most commonly used `varlen causal` mask on both H100 and B200 GPUs, highlighting MagiAttention’s performance and scalability versus other leading CP strategies.

For detailed benchmark settings and results, see the separate [blog post](./cp_benchmark.md).

## Miscellaneous

### Preliminaries

#### Flash Attention 2 Math Derivation

See the separate [blog post](./fa2_math_derivation.md) for a detailed mathematical derivation of the `Flash-Attention 2` forward and backward passes, which serves as the foundation for our `Flex-Flash-Attention` kernel design.


### Extended Functionalities

#### FFA_FA4 Backend for Blackwell

Since `FFA` is built on `FA3` kernels that are available only on Hopper, we provide a temporary `FFA_FA4` backend to enable `MagiAttention` on Blackwell. `FFA_FA4` implements flexible masking via an `HSTU Function` representation based on a forked [`Flash-Attention 4` (`FA4`)](https://github.com/demonatic/flash-attention/tree/magi_attn_blackwell_support).

See the separate [blog post](./blackwell_ffa_fa4.md) for design details and the [Attention Benchmark](./cp_benchmark.md) for Blackwell performance comparisons for both kernel-level and distributed-level.

#### Attention Sink

See the separate [blog post](./attn_sink.md) for a technical description of how we natively support **learnable attention sink mechanism** in `Flex-Flash-Attention` (kernel-level), `MagiAttention` (distributed-level), and `Flash-Attention` (one of the [MagiAttention Extensions](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MagiAttention/tree/main/extensions#flashattention-with-attention-sink-)).

#### Muon QK-Clip

See the separate [blog post](./muon_qk_clip.md) for a technical description of how we natively support **Muon QK-clip technique** in `Flex-Flash-Attention` (kernel-level) and `MagiAttention` (distributed-level).

#### JIT Compilation in FFA

See the separate [blog post](./jit_compile.md) for a technical description of how we support **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation** in `Flex-Flash-Attention`, to reduce pre-building overhead and deliver optimized kernels for varied attention patterns and training scenarios.


### Optimization Techniques

#### Optimize Sparse Attention in FFA

`Sparse Attention` is a promising research direction to trade model capacity for sub-quadratic attention cost using (*static/dynamic*) highly-sparse mask patterns {cite}`child2019generatinglongsequencessparse,beltagy2020longformerlongdocumenttransformer,zaheer2021bigbirdtransformerslonger,zhang2025spargeattentionaccuratetrainingfreesparse`. Recent works such as `NSA` {cite}`yuan2025nativesparseattentionhardwarealigned` and `DSA` {cite}`deepseekai2025deepseekv32pushingfrontieropen` from DeepSeek introduce novel (*dynamic*) trainable sparse attention mechanisms, bringing new opportunities for efficient training. Therefore we've been implementing targeted optimizations on `FFA` for sparse masks to **natively support (distributed) trainable sparse attention**, and share our preliminary results in the separate [blog post](./sparse_attn.md).

### Next-Generation Design

#### Distributed-Native FFA

See the separate [blog post](./dist_native.md) for a technical proposal for the next major version update of `MagiAttention`: a **distributed-native `FFA` kernel** with fused warp-level communication primitives to further reduce communication overhead and kernel launch latency.

#### Attention Engine for Inference

See the separate [blog post](./attn_engine.md) for a technical proposal of the next-generation design named **Attention Engine**, which targets efficient distributed attention serving for inference scenarios.
