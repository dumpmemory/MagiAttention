### How to Use Flex-Flash-Attention

:::{note}
The following snippet shows how to call `flex_flash_attn_func` for the non-distributed (i.e., single-GPU) scenario with a minimal workflow: configuration, tensor initialization, and calculate attention for both forward and backward passes.
:::

```python
import torch
from magi_attention.api import flex_flash_attn_func

# --- Define attention config --- #

total_seqlen = 2048    # 2k tokens
seqlen_sink = 4        # 4 sink tokens
num_heads_q = 8        # number of attention (query) heads
num_heads_kv = 2       # number of key/value heads (GQA)
head_dim = 128         # dimension of each attention head
dtype = torch.bfloat16 # attention activation / computation dtype (while the reduction dtype is always fp32 for ffa right now)
device = "cuda"
has_sink = True        # whether to apply attention sink

# --- Initialize q,k,v,do tensors --- #

q = torch.randn(total_seqlen, num_heads_q, head_dim, dtype=dtype, device=device, requires_grad=True)
k = torch.randn(total_seqlen, num_heads_kv, head_dim, dtype=dtype, device=device, requires_grad=True)
v = torch.randn(total_seqlen, num_heads_kv, head_dim, dtype=dtype, device=device, requires_grad=True)
do = torch.randn_like(q)

# --- Initialize optional sink tensor --- #

sink = torch.randn(seqlen_sink, num_heads_q, dtype=torch.float32, device=device, requires_grad=True) if has_sink else None

# --- Initialize FFA meta args for customized attention mask --- #

# the following customized attention mask looks like (`*` for unmasked, `0` for masked):
#     - - - - - - - - -> (k)
#   | * * * * 0 0 0 0

q_ranges_tensor = torch.tensor([[0, 1024], [1024, 2048]], dtype=torch.int32, device=device)
k_ranges_tensor = torch.tensor([[0, 1024], [0, 2048]], dtype=torch.int32, device=device)
attn_type_map_tensor = torch.tensor([0, 1], dtype=torch.int32, device=device) # full mask for 1st slice, causal mask for 2nd

# --- Attention computation --- #

out, meta = flex_flash_attn_func(
    q=q,
    k=k,
    v=v,
    q_ranges=q_ranges_tensor,
    k_ranges=k_ranges_tensor,
    attn_type_map=attn_type_map_tensor,
    sink=sink, # Defaults to None to not apply attention sink
    softmax_scale=None, # Defaults to 1/sqrt(head_dim)
    softcap=0, # Defaults to 0
)
lse = meta.lse

out.backward(do)

dq, dk, dv = q.grad, k.grad, v.grad
dsink = sink.grad if has_sink else None
```

## Examples

:::{warning}
The following examples are a work in progress. More complete and detailed examples will be provided in a future update.
:::

### Integration with FSDP2

An example demonstrating how to integrate MagiAttention with FSDP2 is provided in [examples/torch_native](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MagiAttention/tree/main/examples/torch_native). Use the included `run.sh` to execute the example.

This example constructs a LLaMA-1B model and demonstrates applying FSDP2 with MagiAttention as the parallelism strategy.

- `examples/torch_native/modeling_llama.py`: Model construction and MagiAttention integration.
- `examples/torch_native/main.py`: Training loop and execution script.


### Integration with Megatron-LM

We maintain a repository [Megatron-LM-MagiAttention](https://github.com/SandAI-org/Megatron-LM-MagiAttention/tree/magi_attention) that demonstrates integrating MagiAttention with Megatron-LM. The repository is forked from [Megatron-LM v0.11.0](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/v0.11.0) and provides a working example for training LLaMA-1B with Megatron-LM + MagiAttention. We also include experiment logs for a LLaMA-3-1B training run to validate convergence.

For more information, consult [examples/megatron](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MagiAttention/tree/main/examples/megatron).


### Integration with Transformers

An integration example for transformers is available in [examples/transformers](https://github.com/SandAI-org/MagiAttention/tree/main/examples/transformers).

We used this integration to run a continued-training experiment on LLaMA-3-1B and validated MagiAttention convergence.
